- Add a way to prevent infinite template recursion.
- Add tests for ValueGetter.
- Add a syntax for defining templates.
  - {{<foo}}template definition goes here{{/foo}}
  - {{>foo}} looks for defined templates before hitting the disk.
  - Looks up context stack.
  - {{>}} invokes parent template with same name?
- Add magic variables like {{$i}} and {{$first}}.
- Add support for variable modifiers like in ctemplate.
  - Need a way to specify custom modifiers.
- Create command-line application.
- Be able to generate static code for later compilation.
  - Would be nice if it didn't use reflection.
- Also, think about dynamically generating code for immediate
  use. May be faster.
- Look into creating an MVC view engine.
