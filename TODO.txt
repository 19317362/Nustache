- Add tests for ValueGetter.
- Make looking up internal templates use sections as scopes
  instead of templates.
- {{>}} invokes parent template with same name?
- Add magic variables like {{$i}} and {{$first}}.
  - Need to work with sections, too, like {{#$first}}first stuff goes here{{/$first}}.
- Add some syntax to define "local" variables?
  - Either that or a way to evaluate variables in templates at definition time.
    - {{<foo}}{{bar!}}{{/foo}}
- Add support for variable modifiers like in ctemplate.
  - Need a way to specify custom modifiers.
- Create command-line application.
- Be able to generate static code for later compilation.
  - Would be nice if it didn't use reflection.
- Also, think about dynamically generating code for immediate
  use. May be faster.
- Look into creating an MVC view engine.
