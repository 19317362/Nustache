- Add a default escape function.
  - Or ability to specify one in the template.
  - Probably passed in as a Func<string, string>.
  - Should it default to HTML escaping or none?
  - Maybe use AntiXss library?
  - {{{variables}}} don't get escaped.
- Render helper methods that read from files should use a template
  locator that reads from the folder containing the template.
- Provide some implementations for locating templates.
  - From a Dictionary<string, Template>.
  - From the file system.
    - Option for multiple paths.
  - From assembly resources.
  - From other locators.
- {{>}} invokes parent template with same name?
- Add magic variables like {{$i}} and {{$first}}.
  - Need to work with sections, too, like {{#$first}}first stuff goes here{{/$first}}.
- Add some syntax to define "local" variables?
  - Either that or a way to evaluate variables in templates at definition time.
    - {{<foo}}{{bar!}}{{/foo}}
- Add support for variable modifiers like in ctemplate.
  - Need a way to specify custom modifiers.
- Create command-line application.
- Be able to generate static code for later compilation.
  - Would be nice if it didn't use reflection.
- Also, think about dynamically generating code for immediate use. May be faster.
- Look into creating an MVC view engine.
