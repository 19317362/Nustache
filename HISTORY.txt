xxx:

- Added support for paths in variable references.
- MVC view engine now uses ViewData is the inital context and not
  ViewData.Model like before. This makes it more like Razor and
  is now possible because we can use paths to get values. This
  may break some templates if you were implicitly getting values
  form your model.
- MVC view engine now supports masters and sections. See the
  Nustache.Mvc3.Example project to see how.

- Removed old MVC projects and examples.
  I can add them back if you really need them.
- First push to NuGet by me.
